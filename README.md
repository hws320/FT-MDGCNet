### FT-MDGCNet
The official pytorch implemention of the paper ["A Feature-Transformed Multi-Dimensional Graph Convolution Network for Skin Lesion Classification"]

### Baseline paper is "Vision GNN: An Image is Worth Graph of Nodes", and the link to its code is "https://github.com/huawei-noah/CV-Backbones".

### Requirement
pytorch 1.10.0
python 3.6

## Useage

### The code directory is the implementation code of the paper and the datasets are the two datasets used in the paper.


### Just run the isic_train.py file in the code directory directly.


### pretrained model 
##  The HAM10000.pth,ISIC2019.pth in the code directory are the pre-trained models on the HAM10000 and ISIC2019 datasets respectively
